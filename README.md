# Using the Registrant Alert API 2.0 web service

[Registrant Alert API](https://registrant-alert.whoisxmlapi.com/api) searches
across all newly registered, renewed & deleted domain names for specific terms
such as registrant's email, organization etc. The API is ideal for monitoring
domain registrants to be alerted whenever their information appears in a
newly-registered domain name.

Here you'll find examples of querying the API implemented in multiple
languages.

You'll need a
[WhoisXmlApi account](https://registrant-alert.whoisxmlapi.com/api/signup) to
authenticate.
You can use either the **X-Authentication-Token** header or the request's body
**apiKey** parameter.

Please, refer to the
[Registrant Alert API User Guide](https://registrant-alert.whoisxmlapi.com/api/documentation/making-requests)
for info on input parameters, request/response formats, authentication
instructions and more.
